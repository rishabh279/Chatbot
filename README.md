# Neural Chatbot
# This project aims at building a chatbot developed using sequence to sequence models in deep learning. The chatbot is fully functional and illustrates how encoders and decoders along with attention mechanism can be used to learn various human conversations efficiently during training. It uses the greedy approach in order to generate the response. The training is done on Cornell Movie-Dialogs Corpus dataset which is performed on Google Cloud Platform so that gpus can be used for faster training.
